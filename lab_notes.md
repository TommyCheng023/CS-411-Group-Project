# Lab04 Notes
## Solution Requirements
1. **Functional Requirements**: define what a product must do, what its features and functions
2. **Nonfunctional Requirements**: describe the general properties of a system, also known as quality attributes

## High-level Requirements
1. Utilize a database.
  * MySQL [recommended]
  * MongoDB [this one is expensive]
  * Oracle Database
2. Two Publicly Available APIs.
  * the source of external resources
  * test API in the very first place please, before start working
      * DATA GOV
      * [NASA APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/)

4. Decoupled Architecture (Client-Server Architecture)
  * use server to connect clients and API

  * 'GET' and 'POST' requests
    * 'GET': get data from
    * 'POST': send data to


## test on APIs [make calls to it]
1. HTTP Request
* mainly in the form of 'GET <url>'
2. Query Parameter
* you can find example query on API websites

## Supporting Tools
1. inspect
